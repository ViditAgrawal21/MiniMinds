# Self Onboarding Screen Consolidation

## Overview
This document outlines the consolidation of the self onboarding flow from multiple individual screens into a single, manageable screen.

## What Was Changed

### Before
The self onboarding flow consisted of 6 separate screens:
- `self1.tsx` - Personal information (name, DOB, gender)
- `self2.tsx` - Life status questions (3 questions)
- `self3.tsx` - Social media & digital wellbeing (2 questions)
- `self4.tsx` - Physical & emotional indicators (3 questions)
- `self5.tsx` - Stress & physical symptoms (2 questions)
- `selfthankyou.tsx` - Completion screen

### After
All functionality has been consolidated into:
- `SelfOnboarding.tsx` - Single screen with step-based navigation

## Key Features of the New Screen

### 1. Step-based Navigation
- Uses a `currentStep` state to manage which content to display
- Progress bar shows completion percentage
- Total of 6 steps (5 onboarding steps + thank you)

### 2. State Management
- All form states are maintained in a single component
- Data is saved at each step to AsyncStorage
- Supports loading previously saved responses

### 3. Scoring System
- Maintains the original scoring logic from each screen
- Calculates individual section scores and overall score
- Preserves all weight calculations and scoring algorithms

### 4. Navigation Updates
- Updated `AppNavigation.js` to use single `SelfOnboarding` screen
- Updated navigation types in `types.ts`
- Fixed all references to individual self screens throughout the app

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
- `/src/screens/main/self/SelfOnboarding.tsx` - Consolidated screen
- `/src/screens/main/self/index.ts` - Export file

### Files Updated
- `/src/navigation/AppNavigation.js` - Updated screen imports and navigation
- `/src/navigation/types.ts` - Updated type definitions
- `/src/screens/main/languageSelect/languageSelectScreen.tsx` - Updated navigation target
- `/src/screens/main/selforchild.tsx` - Updated navigation target
- `/src/screens/main/profile-page/index.tsx` - Updated navigation target

### Original Files (Can be removed)
- `/src/screens/main/self/self1.tsx`
- `/src/screens/main/self/self2.tsx`
- `/src/screens/main/self/self3.tsx`
- `/src/screens/main/self/self4.tsx`
- `/src/screens/main/self/self5.tsx`
- `/src/screens/main/self/selfthankyou.tsx`

## Benefits

1. **Easier Maintenance**: Single file to maintain instead of 6
2. **Better User Experience**: No screen transitions between steps
3. **Consistent State**: All data managed in one place
4. **Simplified Navigation**: Reduced navigation complexity
5. **Better Performance**: Fewer screen components to load

## Data Compatibility

The new screen maintains complete compatibility with:
- All existing AsyncStorage keys
- All scoring algorithms
- All translation keys
- All data structures

## Testing Considerations

When testing the new consolidated screen:
1. Verify all steps display correctly
2. Ensure back/forward navigation works
3. Test data persistence between steps
4. Verify scoring calculations match original logic
5. Test skip functionality
6. Confirm completion flow works correctly

## Future Enhancements

The consolidated approach makes it easier to:
- Add new questions or steps
- Implement dynamic routing based on responses
- Add validation rules across steps
- Implement better progress tracking
- Add step-specific animations
