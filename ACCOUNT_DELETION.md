## How to request account deletion

You can request deletion of your ThoughtPro account at any time by emailing us.

1. Compose an email to syneptlabs@gmail.com from the email address linked to your ThoughtPro account.  
2. Subject line: DELETE MY THOUGHTPRO ACCOUNT  
3. Include the following details in the email body:
   - Your full name (optional but helpful)
   - The email address used to sign in to ThoughtPro
   - Platform (Android / iOS) and app version (if known)
   - A statement that you want your account and data permanently deleted
4. Send the email. We will acknowledge receipt and begin the verification process.

If you no longer have access to the registered email address, include any available proof of account ownership (e.g., last sign-in method, approximate last login date). We may request additional information to verify your identity before proceeding.

## Identity verification

To protect your data, we verify each deletion request. We may:
- Reply to the registered email address for confirmation, and/or
- Send a one-time confirmation code to the email on file, and/or
- Ask for limited additional information strictly to confirm ownership.

We will not delete an account until ownership is verified.

## What gets deleted

Once verified and processed, we will permanently delete the following data associated with your account:
- Account identifiers (name, email, user ID)
- Profile information you provided in the app
- App preferences and settings
- In-app activity data and content you created (e.g., notes, saved items, history)
- Device/account links used for sign-in to ThoughtPro

After deletion, you will lose access to your account and any data or content stored within it.

## What we may retain (and why)

Certain data may be retained for a limited period as permitted or required by law, for fraud prevention, security, or compliance:
- Support emails and records of your deletion request (up to 24 months)
- Minimal audit logs necessary to demonstrate that the deletion occurred
- Aggregated or irreversibly de-identified analytics that cannot be linked back to you

We do not retain personal data beyond what is necessary for the reasons above.

---

## Backups and retention period

- Primary deletion: within 30 days after verifying your request
- Backups and disaster-recovery copies: purged on their regular cycles, typically within 90 days after primary deletion

During the retention window, your data will not be used for any active product features and will be restricted to security, compliance, and backup integrity needs only.

## Cancellation and reactivation

Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone once completed. If you change your mind before we confirm completion, reply to the same email thread as soon as possible; we will attempt to cancel if processing has not yet finalized.

## Children’s accounts and guardians

If you are a parent or legal guardian requesting deletion for a child’s account, please indicate your relationship in your email. We may request additional verification to protect the child’s privacy.
